          Jing was a wonderful colleague and a bright spirit that uplifted
          those around him. He was particularly kind and welcoming to
          newcomers which many of us at CITA are. Please write your thoughts
          to contact@domij.info. They will be collected and sent to Jing's
          family.
        </p></blockquote> <h2>English</h2> <p>
        “In the short time that I knew Jing, he made such a positive impact on
        me when I joined CITA. He would come to talk and joke with me every
        day in my office. We'd always say “What's new?!” to each other,
        finally deciding to write it on my white board, and he would just
        point at it and laugh. He visited my arts market to support me over
        the holidays and put in a request for me to paint a “space cat” for
        him, which I regret not doing but will do now as tribute. We only
        spoke the other day on the phone about fun CITA activities in the
        future. Such a bright person that took time out of his day for anyone.
        He'll be truly, truly missed.” - Emily Hall
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was always kind, interested and gracious. From talks and formal
        interactions to passing words in the hallway, he was a truly sunny
        presence at CITA and in the UofT astro community. Thank you Jing for
        your generosity.” Renée Hlozek
      </p> <p>
        “"It is difficult for me to express how sad I feel about Jing's death.
        Every time we bumped into each other, he always had a big grin on his
        face and there always seemed to be the obligatory need to exchange a
        dumb joke or two. I remember when he first arrived, he used to roam
        the halls wearing this crazy cowboy hat. I asked him what that was all
        about and he shared with me a little bit about his time in
        Brownsville, TX. As a newcomer from China, everything was strange but
        he was soon taken under the wing by some new local friends who helped
        him get settled and started calling him Santiago. He embraced the new
        name and the hat was part of that adopted persona. His doorplate read
        Jing Santiago Luo. He was just a genuinely kind and caring person who
        enjoyed life and people. I am heartbroken by this news and will miss
        him greatly." -John Dubinski
      </p> <p>
        “Thank you Jing for the times you spared teaching me pulsar concepts
        and how to use the TEMPO software. I didn't realize that I would be
        saying this in a tribute after the long physical absence caused by the
        pandemic. You will surely be missed!” Adaeze Ibik
      </p> <p>
        "Jing was a fun and engaging person, and so stories grew around him.
        He microwaved his chequebook, brought his mom to an observing run at
        Algonquin (she helped the owner's family build a lego set), and named
        and designed a badge for "Taskforce 125" who installed a christmas
        tree feed. I'd like to thank him for getting me out of my comfort zone
        to try new things (like paintball). He will be missed!" -- Daniel Baker
      </p> <p>
        “We never finished our friendship expedition or the Olympics on the
        Astronomy Minecraft server, and now I am regretful that we never will.
        One time when we were having dinner, he told us that what he really
        loved was to make everyone at the table happy. He truly did with his
        many, many colorful and animated stories. See you, Rocket Cowboy.” -
        Fang Xi Lin
      </p> <p>
        “Jing's jokes and positive attitude were some of my favourite things
        about going into the office. He would always make sure to say hi, make
        a joke, or offer help whenever he would walk by. He truly went out of
        his way to make people feel welcome and included by organizing social
        events or simply chatting over a coffee (he racked up a lot of points
        at Starbucks, and was always trying to get the baristas to call him
        Rocket Cowboy). With family day coming up I am reminded how he
        organized a hot pot party for family day in 2019 because he treated
        his colleagues like family. He is deeply missed. Rest in peace,
        Santiago.” -- Ashley Stock
      </p> <p>
        I did not know you well, Jing, but you left an impression! I remember
        him as a regular presence in the "before times" when the postdocs
        would get together for "postdoc-a-palooza". He was a cheerful and
        funny guy. You will be missed. --Jennifer West
      </p> <p>
        “Most of the knocks on my office door were Jing's. He would stop by
        mostly to talk to my officemate who was in his research group but
        would always strike a conversation with me regardless of whether my
        friend was in the office or not. He loved the nerf guns in our office
        and would threaten us with nerf gun fights. Even during the pandemic,
        when MP's 12th floor wasn't as busy, Jing would stop by and talk to me
        when I was in the office. He was such a friendly, lively, and positive
        presence. Hard to believe that there won't be any more knocks on my
        office doors or lively conversations and nerf gun fights with him. I'm
        glad to have crossed paths with him and will miss him terribly. Rest
        in peace, Jing.” - Eesha Das Gupta
      </p> <p>
        “From the day he strode into Toronto wearing his iconic ten-gallon
        hat, Jing embodied community. With a larger-than-life persona, Jing
        took pride in making his own adventures -- and finding ways to enthrall
        you into them. Regardless of the hazards or challenges, if you were
        with him on an escapade, you knew there'd be a story to tell. It was a
        special talent that he had, to be able to challenge you out of your
        comfort zone but give you the support you needed to get there. That's
        why people gravitated towards him. As he transitioned from newcomer to
        pillar of the community, it was clear that he was intentional about
        making everyone who crossed his path feel welcome. Behind the big
        grin, the zany story, or the ever-so-slightly irreverent joke, was
        both purpose and heart. We are a poorer place without Jing, but we are
        richer for having had him in our lives.” --Mubdi Rahman </p> <p> 
        “Jing was one
        of the first people I met when I started at UofT. I remember meeting
        him at the summer/fall bbq on Toronto Island, and he was the
        friendliest and most welcoming person! I only saw him a few times
        after that before the pandemic moved everything online, but whenever I
        did see him he always said hi and we would have a lovely chat. He
        truly knew how to make people feel welcomed and part of a community.
        You will be missed, Jing. My sincerest condolences to Jing's family,
        friends, colleagues, and everyone who knew him.” - Gwen Eadie </p> <p> 
        “Jing
        radiated this undeniable warmth the moment he stepped into the
        DADDAA/Dunlap staff corridor. He would often walk down the hallway to
        greet staff members such as myself and poke his head into our offices
        for a quick hello. I always welcomed and enjoyed these chats, as they
        lit up the rest of my day. One of the last conversations I had with
        him was about his cool denim jacket that I noticed included some fun
        Star Wars embroidery. His face immediately lit up with excitement as
        he told me more about it (how he got it personalized and carefully
        selected the placement of the design). I will never forget the way he
        made me feel. Two years of a pandemic and social distancing were
        taxing. Yet in this brief exchange, I vividly remember thinking, this
        energy is exactly what I missed about coming into the office'. Jing,
        thank you for always spreading joy by being exactly the kind of person
        you are.” - Joanna Baylon
      </p> <p>
        “Jing welcomed me so kindly in my first months at Dunlap, when I
        joined his team at ARO to try to understand how all this astronomy
        stuff worked. For those three days, he took so much time out of his
        own schedule to explain the research to me, and to make me feel
        welcome within the group. His enthusiasm for both science in
        particular - and life in general - was special and extraordinary. My
        thoughts are with his family.” - Meaghan MacSween
      </p> <p>
        “The morning of February 15, Jing was still at the weekly
        scintillometry group meeting. His knowledge of pulsar observations and
        dedication to research really showed. In the brief time that I've
        known Jing, he was a friendly and helpful individual, as all the
        comments here have been highlighting. He taught me how to use the ARO
        Kotekan system, and was always there to offer guidance and advice
        whenever I was stuck. He really made a newcomer like me become more
        comfortable on the trip; his gravity/anti-gravity sphere problem will
        be remembered. Thank you Jing for all your efforts to not only further
        the field of pulsar research, but also making everyone feel welcomed
        and entertained.” - Alice Chen
      </p> <p>
        “Jing always has lots of stories and jokes to tell. My limited ability
        in writing has stopped me from expressing how much fun he has brought
        to us. I will never forget the enjoyable nights at his balcony during
        the covid. His cheerful character will always be remembered and
        missed.” -Dongzi Li
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was the kind of person with that rare talent of being able to
        make everyone feel immediately welcome. He made sure that, as long as
        he was around, nobody ever felt small or unimportant. It was obvious
        to anyone that knew him how genuinely he cared about others. I regret
        having never expressed to him how important he is to this community,
        and I can only hope that he knew. He made a deep impact on everyone he
        met, even those he had only known for a short while, and his absence
        will be felt profoundly. May his memory be a blessing.” - Dylan Jow
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was a beautiful human being in so many ways: kind, funny,
        generous, welcoming, talented, helpful. I got to know him on a trip to
        Algonquin (ARO) in 2019, and although I had never met him before, he
        already treated me like I was his best friend, and we shared countless
        laughs. He would often come visit our lab in the following months, and
        we'd always have fun. I remember not long before the pandemic started,
        he was back from a conference and brought souvenirs (pictures of the
        Crab nebula), which he gave around as gifts, and that made me very
        happy. He knew how to make people smile, and everyone who interacted
        with him liked him. He really seemed to care about everyone. He will
        be missed.” - Vincent MacKay

        How I remember Jing: affable, cheerful, balanced, down-to-earth,
        funny, humble. I was surprised at how many of us he knew and talked to
        in the DADDAA/Dunlap administrative office suite--especially
        considering that his office was in another building, and up 12-flights
        of stairs. He seemed to take the time to meet and know everyone.
        Having those moments to talk to Jing were a highlight each day. This
        is a sad loss for University of Toronto Astronomy. I'll never forget
        all the memorable exchanges we had during his time with us, which was
        all too brief. - Andrew Apong

        “Jing hosted me during my first visit to CITA back in 2017, and took
        us for an incredible meal in a Chinatown restaurant. Jing had this
        ability to bring real warmth and happiness into any group of people,
        and he had us in stitches of laughter that evening. Since moving to
        Toronto, I realised that Jing held this level of joy and openness
        wherever he went. I don't think I ever once saw him at CITA without a
        smile on his face or a happy word to give. The magnitude of this loss
        to the community will be very sorely felt by us all.” - Ted Mackereth
      </p> <p>
        “Dear Jing, thank you so much for being the most wonderful colleague!
        We've only started working together closely half a year ago, but
        you've been very welcoming when I moved to Toronto and you were always
        happy to help and jump on a call to discuss or explain some work
        problem -- that was so generous of you and I regret never thanking you
        properly for it. I'll remember fondly the trip to Bruce Peninsula that
        you organized for us and I'll try to be as nice to everyone I meet as
        you were, it was always fun being around you and you were truly an
        exemplary scientist and person.” Ziggy Pleunis
      </p> <p>
        “I worked with Jing since the early days of his PhD work in Texas and
        very closely since then on the PINT software for pulsar timing (and on
        other NANOGrav and CHIME things). He was a wonderful collaborator and
        a truly beautiful person. He loved life and science and pulsars (yay!)
        and had only positive and upbeat things to say about anything and
        everything. I'm usually a pretty stoic guy, but hearing about Jing's
        death hit me really hard. That is truly a testament to how lovely of a
        person he was and how terribly premature his death is. I will miss him
        a lot. Cheers, Jing.” - Scott Ransom
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was always looking for something zany to get excited about. One
        of my favorite stories is when he ran into the lounge during CITA
        desserts, stating 'Hey! There is a ghost in my office!' Jing had
        figured out that if you pressed the white board in his office, an old
        buzzer would go off in another office down the hall, and insisted this
        was a ghost. But when I followed him to the office, he excitedly went
        over to the white board, turned around to look at me expectantly, and
        continuously pressed the white board with nothing happening. 'See,
        don't you hear the ghost?!' 'No Jing, I don't man,' I said back. He
        kept on pushing other random parts of the whiteboard trying to get the
        buzzer to ring, saying again 'Do you hear it now? How about now? What
        about this?' 'Still no man, and you know I think you're going nutz,
        right?' I replied. He kept at it, until finally there was a sudden
        ring across the hall, and he blurted out 'There it is! There is the
        ghost!' We went back and forth for a good fifteen minutes letting the
        'ghost' express itself, and now a firm believer in the afterlife, Jing
        and I went back to the CITA lounge to tell everyone else about the
        whiteboard ghost. I already miss Jing, and the bright light he was in
        the department. The world is a sadder place without him” -J. J.

        “I met Jing at one of the IPTA meetings. He soon became one of the
        people I was looking forward to seeing at these annual conferences,
        always funny and kind, and usually greeting me in my language, of
        which he asked me to teach him some words. We have always had a lot of
        laughs together, and he really made those times lighter and more
        friendly. One of the first things that I remember him for, was that
        they had tasked him to prepare a short talk on the SKA at one of the
        student weeks of the IPTA, and he prepared an hilarious crossover
        between SKA, the telescope, and SKA, the music. I was falling from the
        chair. I am at a loss for words for what happened. I miss him deeply.”

        I was lucky to work and share projects with Jing for a few years;
        sadly, it ended too soon. He brought up the best of everyone, from
        helping to reach and exceed work goals to having fun and joy to
        celebrate them. Thank you Jing, for your time and the great memories.
        I will treasure them for life. -Jose Jauregui
      </p> <p>
        Jing was one of the friendliest, most welcoming people in our Astro
        community. He was always thinking of others and wanted to make
        everyone feel good about themselves. He always made time to chat or
        ask what was new in your life. One day I had an errand to run in the
        CITA building and didn't know my way around. Jing was hanging out in
        the hallway and immediately decided to take me on the “grand tour” and
        introduce me to people in CITA I hadn't met yet. At one point we
        accidentally laughed at something much too loudly and a bunch of
        people came out of their offices to see what all of the commotion was
        about. THAT was the energy he brought with him every time that I saw
        him. I last spoke to Jing on Zoom a few days ago. In true Jing fashion
        he was looking for advice on planning a fun adventure/event for CITA
        folks to boost everyone's spirits after a long two years of pandemic
        life. I felt like I was just doing my job, but he was so grateful for
        the advice that he insisted we go to Dessert Lady (one of his
        favourite bakeries in the city) this week as a treat to thank me. I am
        saddened that now we won't get to do that. His energy, enthusiasm and
        care for others will be missed terribly. -- Kara Manovich
      </p> <p>
        Jing is always kind, interesting and energetic. I remembered all the
        interesting time when I bumped into him in the coffee room, in the
        hallway, or by the telescope on the top floor. I have promised to
        visit him at the Algonquin radio telescope this summer. It is such a
        pity this trip can never be completed. Thank you for the great
        memories, Jing. We will miss you. -- Xinyu Li
      </p> <p>
        Jing was bright, had a wonderful heart and was always joyful. He was
        one of my closest friends and a true confidant. I had the privilege of
        connecting with him early on in my life, as I worked through my
        degrees, he was a mentor. Most of our conversations were about having
        an impact bigger than ourselves, making a difference in the world, and
        empowering the new generations through education. Jing lived his life
        to the fullest. He always tried to instill that in me. We had the
        fortune to travel together plenty: to Paris, Malaysia and in the US.
        When I visited him in Canada, it was not different. We traveled
        through Alberta and at several stops, he made me wait in the freezing
        cold so that he could take photo exposures of the galaxy. Another time
        for a picture of a train at a location he felt was just the right
        view. He was true to his passions. Jing held himself to a higher
        standard and always inspired me to do the same. I can't begin to put
        the feelings of this loss into words. Truly, there are no words of
        comfort I can give right now but I know that my life was better for
        having known Jing. Let's carry Jing's kindness, compassion and love
        with us as our tribute to a great man. Until we meet again my dear
        Jing, AKA: Santiago & Space Cowboy. -- Keeisi Caballero
      </p> <p>
        Jing was probably the first person I met in the US, when I first set
        foot in Brownsville, TX. He kindly picked me up at the airport
        together with Doming and Yan Wang, and introduced me to the new life
        in a different continent. We had a great 2 years during my stay in
        Brownsville. We were officemates, friends and family in Texas. We went
        to lunches and dinners, joined seminars and played games together
        (Jing was really good at Borderlands). We went to Yucatan, Mexico for
        a spring break and it was such a wonderful trip. We also had a lot of
        delicious Chinese food at Jing's house, cooked by his visiting
        parents. Jing was always positive and energetic, quick to blend into
        crowds with his characteristic smile, waving to everyone, greeting
        with pleasure. He organized my master's graduation grill party at
        Brownsville, after which I moved on to New York for Ph.D. We had only
        occasional contacts since then, but I remember vividly how glad I was
        when I had to present a paper on Pulsar Timing on the next day but
        knew nothing about it, but then I found Jing was on the author list.
        He kindly explained every detail of the paper to me and my
        presentation was a huge success that I won a reference letter from the
        professor. The last time I met Jing was in early 2019 when he visited
        my apartment on the long island. We had a nice dinner at Five Guys,
        one of his favorite fast food restaurants, enjoying some peanuts,
        burgers and nostalgia. He stayed for one night, but unfortunately I
        wasn't able to see him off at the train station the next morning, due
        to an emergency of a friend. I never thought that night would be the
        last time I would see him. How I wish that I at least said goodbye
        that day! I will definitely miss him, and I will always remember him
        as a friend and a big brother. --Shuang Liang
      </p> <p>
        Jing was one of the people that made me feel very welcome when I first
        arrived at UofT. He was one of the last people I hung out with before
        the lock downs started in 2019, when he invited me to a social outing
        (movies + ice skating). He had just got back from China and had the
        foresight to make the most of the time we had before the pandemic.
        This made a big difference to me since I didn't know that many people
        in Toronto and it was a meaningful experience that I could reflect on
        after lockdowns started. I will miss the inspiring conversations with
        him teaching me about pulsars and scintillation. -- Luke Pratley
      </p> <p>
        Jing's office is in a different building than mine. I did not have a
        lot of interactions with him. But that did not stop him leaving a
        lasting impression. He was always friendly and pleasant. Every time he
        came to the Astronomy Building, he would stop by to say hi. He had the
        ability to make people around him relaxed. It was such a shock to
        learn his passing. Astronomy community lost a bright young mind. May
        peace be with you, Jing! -Hugh Zhao
      </p> <p>
        Jing is one of the very first CITA friends that I know after arriving
        in Toronto in the middle of the pandemic. I remember that after we
        came back to the office, Jing was a frequent guest of my office —
        though he mostly came for Antoine! (I'm jealous!). The time we spent
        with him at lunch was always full of fun. He seemed to know almost
        every great dining place in town. In the fall last year, Jing
        organized the CITA paintball game at Barrie which several of us really
        really enjoyed. I think I hadn't played paintball since my childhood
        before that day! We were talking about going for a second time in
        winter, when we could shoot each other in the snow for fun! But
        eventually we didn't make it. Jing is very special. He is extremely
        knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor. I will miss him like
        many others will do. I'm really glad to have known him in Toronto. I
        feel proud of him as his colleague and friend. — Lichen Liang
      </p> <p>
        To me Luo Jing is a person with tremendous warmth, humor and
        reliability. He can always enliven the atmosphere and share his full
        of energy. I still remember the last time we met in person, two months
        before the start of the global pandemic, we were gathering for lunch
        at Koh Lipe Thai on Baldwin Street with other Chinese friends in
        Toronto. He hilariously introduced us the Thai food he had, the
        difference between Texas and Toronto, and those new discoveries by
        CHIME. When I asked him, out of curiosity, why he took the English
        name 'Santiago', he smiled slyly and then showed us a picture of him
        wearing that iconic cowboy hat. I was carrying my luggage to go to the
        airport after the meal, and there he raised his hand, waving, and
        wishing me: 'Bon Voyage!'. I never expected it was the last time to
        see him. Rest in piece, Jing. — Qing Liu
      </p> <p>
        Jing, your curiosity and sense of humour brightened the 12th floor
        immensely, but I had so much more to learn and appreciate about you.
        Clear trails forever, Space Cowboy. -- Chris Matzner
      </p> <p>
        Jing had an unquenchable joy and energy. In any social gathering he
        would always take centre stage and regale us with tales of his
        escapades. He was an all round person who did not shy away from a
        challenge and was always eager to lend a hand. We spent a lot of time
        together in CITA, at the AAS meeting right before the pandemic, and
        continued to stay in touch during the pandemic. I'm terribly saddened
        that he's gone. The world lost not only a brilliant scientist, but
        also a kind and cheerful mensch. - Almog Yalinewich
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was a kind and exuberant human who never failed to brighten any
        room (physical or virtual) that he was in. I first met him at the
        summer BBQ on Toronto Island in 2019, at which he was so incredibly
        welcoming and inclusive. Despite not knowing each other well, he
        generously offered to look after my cat so I could go home to see my
        family over the holidays, and sent pictures of their adventures every
        day to put my mind at ease. When he later returned from AAS in early
        2020, he brought me back a space cat pin from one of the exhibitors as
        a surprise, which has pride of place on my backpack to this day. There
        are no words to adequately express the sadness from his passing. I'm
        so thankful to have known him, but sorrowful that it was for such a
        short time. He will be terribly missed. The world was a better place
        for his presence in it. Rest in peace, Jing.” —Sarah Gossan
      </p> <p>
        “Jing and I joined the scintillometry group in CITA as postdocs at the
        same time in 2018, and we have been closely working on various
        projects, which the majority of them are complicated and involved in
        several telescopes. Jing's excellent communication and friendly nature
        made the coordination smooth. Outside of work, Jing is also very
        generous and kind toward people. He learned some recipes from his chef
        friends, made those nice dishes, and invited friends to enjoy
        together. I still remember the grilled Portabello mushroom with cheese
        and vinegar he made, as well as the delicious grilled shrimps! In
        addition, helping others seems like his daily routine. I remember that
        he helped many CITAzen, including myself, to move around. We had a
        very good time in Toronto in the past years, and I will always
        remember the precious moments. Thank you Jing and rest in peace.”--

        I met Jing while I was an undergrad, and he was visiting our
        university (UTRGV) in 2019 for a few days, mutual friends introduced
        us and when I asked him for his name he said for me to call him “space
        cowboy” only, even though I would eventually find out his name.
        Without knowing me for long he was the nicest, most outgoing person,
        and funniest person I had met. In those few days of knowing each other
        he would offer to buy my friend and I Starbucks to study with as a
        treat and offer endless knowledge and jokes. We kept in touch after he
        returned to Canada through social media. Jing was brilliant, always
        positive and always knew how to make someone feel comfortable and
        welcomed, he broke through your personal space to allow you to be
        included and you just knew he was the type of person you wanted to be
        friends with. I will be forever grateful for his kindness. Until next
        time Jing, - Brina Martinez
      </p> <p>
        Jing, my good friend Jing. I don't know where to begin. Jing came to
        Canada many years ago and I had the honor of meeting him and sharing
        an office with him at CITA. On top of that, he was my mentor and
        supervisor - someone I learned so much from - the most inspiring of
        scientists to me. Throughout my time at CITA, Jing and I became close
        friends. He always made me laugh and had the best jokes. He was an
        uplifting person to be around, if you were having a bad day, Jing
        would always make sure you have a smile on your face at the end of the
        day. He was always up for a new adventure - always saying yes to new
        experiences, I mean he moved countries! He tried skating for the first
        time and enjoyed the beauty around him through his photography. We
        were even planning a hike soon! He was a beautiful person inside and
        out. He brought light with his presence and to everyone around him. We
        are lucky to have had him and I am forever grateful. I will never
        forget your teachings and friendship. I will keep you in my heart and
        mind, for always. - Caroline El Khoury
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was one of the first people I met when I arrived at CITA in Nov
        2020. I met him on the first day I went into the office. That was the
        second day I came out from a 2-week quarantine. I will not forget the
        immense positive energy Jing radiated, which cleared my quarantine
        blues literally instantly. With his presence, there just seemed to be
        no room for any blues, no time to delay for a good laugh.<br>
        I will not forget how Jing immediately made me feel so welcomed in
        this new community and new country to me. Bumping into Jing in the
        CITA hallway and CITA lounge was always fun. I recall him throwing me
        a piece of chocolate the moment we said hi. His uplifting spirit
        lifted my energy, and his shared chocolate fuelled my research. Thank
        you, Jing, for your indirect contribution to the study of the magnetic
        ionised Universe on the largest scales! I also remember the fun and
        meaningful chat with Jing after last year's Christmas party. We walked
        past the UofT campus, chatting about random little things and big and
        deep topics (e.g. culture in the East and the West; making a research
        environment better for everyone). As Jing and I walked towards the
        north, we bumped into Pavel (another CITA postdoc), who walked
        southwards to look for his gloves. It was a freezing evening, but
        nothing could stop us from standing in the cold to have a chat and
        check everyone was okay. It was a wintry evening, but there was warmth
        coming through from our conversation, about the communities we are
        part of and care for and about the general good life. Jing was a star,
        shining so bright and radiating warmth to people around him and
        beyond. I count myself blessed to be his colleague. My heartfelt thank
        you to Jing "Santiago" Luo. “ — Jennifer Yik-ham Chan
      </p> <p>
        “When I look back on my career to date, I usually think of Jing. He
        was one of the first people I met when I began traveling to
        conferences in our field of pulsar science. Jing's humor and presence
        always struck me as iconic, and was perfectly matched with his
        friendliness, ability to welcome everyone around him, and sheer
        intelect. I always could count on Jing to be at the next conference,
        be up for food and beers, rally mutual friends for downtime after a
        full day of work, and get good work done. I remember a wild time where
        Jing and I attended an international pulsar conference in Banff,
        Alberta, in 2014, and we ran into an 'alpha elk' while leaving the
        conference facility for the downtown area to meet up with friends! We
        just stood in silence and awe of this massive elk, who in turn just
        stared us down before leaving a minute or two later. We then carried
        on to an amazing evening of dinner and karaoke. Whenever we finally
        detect gravitational waves with nanohertz frequencies, they'll be
        found using Jing's work. You're a legend, Jing. I'll miss ya.” --
        Emmanuel Fonseca
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was a bright example of the important role each scientist can
        play in stimulating and encouraging the work of others. It is
        increasingly clear that a revolution is afoot in radio astronomy,
        which Jing has so eagerly helped push forward. I'm deeply saddened
        that he will not see all the fruits of his labors, or have the chance
        to be the leader that he seemed destined to be. Talking to Jing has
        always been one of the joys of working at CITA, or indeed walking the
        nearby streets of Toronto -- like many charismatic people he seemed to
        have the ability to pop up frequently, always eager to hear and impart
        the latest news. My deepest condolences go especially to his family,
        but also to everyone who had the benefit of working closely with him.”
        -- Chris Thompson
      </p> <p>
        “I am extremely saddened and shocked to hear this news. Jing was a
        good friend and I will always have good memories of him. His office
        was right beside mine and he would drop in often to chat and borrow
        the nerf guns in our office, although he'd always be sure to return it
        somehow without us realizing. He was very friendly and when I moved to
        Toronto in 2019 as an international student, he made me feel very
        welcome here. I will always be thankful for that. He was close with
        many of the graduate students and we often called him an 'honorary'
        grad student since he would attend our parties and outings and make
        them more lively with his presence. He was also very dedicated,
        hard-working and considerate. I remember in December 2019, when the MP
        building was empty, Jing and I used to be the only people on the 12th
        floor. We went out to celebrate on Christmas eve/day since we were the
        only ones in Toronto we knew of who weren't celebrating Christmas.
        When I was alone in Toronto during the winter break, he made it much
        more livelier and I will always be grateful for his company. Rest in
        peace, Jing. I hope your family finds strength in this dark time.” -

        “I met Jing when I was an undergrad just starting pulsar research (I'm
        currently finishing up my PhD thesis) and he's been one of my favorite
        collaborators ever since. His positivity, kindness, enthusiasm, and
        humor lit up every room he was in, and I always looked forward to
        seeing him at meetings. Though I didn't often work directly with him,
        we've kept in touch throughout my career and his guidance and
        willingness to answer any questions (even if it was the 5th time I
        asked how to push things to the GitHub repository….) have made such a
        difference. Not only did he do amazing work that has been instrumental
        in NANOGrav science, but he also made the collaboration a better place
        with his positive attitude and passion for science. You will be dearly
        missed, Jing.” -- Haley Wahl
      </p> <p>
        “I found myself needing to explain Jing to people a few times to
        contextualize the news. And every time, I ended up describing him as
        the best Texan I ever knew even if he was originally from China. Texas
        is a state of mind, and Jing had it in the very best way. He
        brightened up every room he was in with his always unpredictable
        proclamations. You never quite knew where he was going with things,
        but in the end you almost always ended up laughing. He wasn't a
        perfect person - none of us are - but he was a person with a huge
        heart. I remember, shortly pre-covid, having a bit of a panic about
        some admin stuff at a busy week, and Jing paused what he was doing to
        talk me down and make sure I was doing okay. I'll miss him a lot as a
        collaborator and as a friend.” --Deborah Good
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was a leader filled with bright ideas, initiative, and hard
        work, and more importantly an absolute joy in life and a way of
        brightening the world around him. He will be deeply missed.” --Ingrid

        “I have the most vivid memory of meeting Jing during my first day at
        CITA. He sat in the conference room with his Texan cowboy hat and
        immediately made me feel welcome in the group. He quickly became a
        beloved friend, mentor and collaborator. Jing was gregarious,
        passionate and had a zest for life that was absolutely contagious. I
        was also fortunate enough to go on several observation trips to
        Algonquin with him where I learned a lot from him as a scientist. Jing
        was very adventurous and the time we took the canoe together to the
        end of the lake is one of my most cherished memories. We ate lunch
        together almost every week and shared countless laughs and stories.
        Even after I left CITA, Jing always stayed in touch. He was an
        endearing friend who's positive energy always brightened my day and I
        will never forget his presence. I will miss you so much, Jing” -
        Akanksha Bij
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was one of the first people I met in the astronomy department.
        We were in a breakout room together on a Zoom call and we started
        talking about sci-fi novels we read and found a common interest there.
        We communicated several times after this about the novels and about
        astro. He was always so welcoming and kind and open to chatting about
        anything. Though we didn't get to know each other too well, I will
        miss him and the energy he brings to every conversation.” - Daniella
        Morrone
      </p> <p>
        “Jing / Santiago will probably always be the most Texan friend I ever
        had. He was an interesting, goofy, fun character full of great stories
        and experiences, and he wanted to share them with everyone — whether
        it was a funny tale about Texas, beautiful photos from his adventures
        in nature, or pride in his gym community for working out outside in
        the bitter days of Canadian winter throughout the pandemic. He had the
        biggest heart that somehow had room to care about everyone around him.
        He invariably welcomed people, gave people his time and full energy,
        and created opportunities for the community to come together. He went
        all-in on friendship: after only a few months of knowing him, he was
        talking about planning a road trip through the US national parks
        together. He deserved to have many more adventures and form many more
        friendships in life. I will share a few personal examples of his kind
        soul. One morning he appeared on his bike as I was walking to the
        office. He stopped to say hello, and like Santa Claus on a bike, he
        randomly pulled out of his bag some artistic bookmarks that he had
        gotten from the Met on a recent trip to New York, and said 'these are
        for you.' After a few minutes of chatting, he biked off, but the sweet
        gesture and few moments seeing his big smile brightened the rest of my
        day. During the first few months of the pandemic when I was at home in
        the US, he regularly sent me memes, as well as photos of the flowers
        in Toronto when spring began. These small gestures made me feel
        connected in a lonely time. A few days after my birthday this year, I
        came into my office to see a gift on my desk. I had an inkling it was
        from Jing. I messaged him to ask if he knew who it was from, and he
        replied in his funny way, “Let Martine know. It was me.” The gift was
        a hydroponic flower pot with sunflower seeds. They're planted, and I
        wish I could show him how they look when they grow. I'll cherish the
        memories of exploring Toronto, dancing forró, hanging out at
        department events, going for coffee, and just chatting in the halls.
        Thank you for everything, Jing. I'll miss you.” - Martine Lokken
      </p> <p>
        Jing was such a dear friend and had an incredibly warming and
        energetic presence everywhere he went. Any time there was a group
        outing, he was there. I have such fond memories of him at parties,
        going to the ballet, festivals, markets, and all kinds of events. He
        always made an effort to get to know my friends, and even those who
        only met him once or twice have strong memories of him. That's just
        how he was - his energy and personality left such a huge impression on
        everyone. When I started training in pointe shoes, he was super
        encouraging and excited for me. He always sent supportive messages
        when I posted videos or photos on social media. When he went to AAS a
        few years ago, he also brought me back a really cute cat pin, which
        has been on my dance bag ever since! One of my favourite memories of
        him was a time at CITA desserts. I was wearing a t-shirt of mine that
        has the Joy Division “Unknown Pleasures”/pulsar graphic, except
        they're cats. He said to me (quite smugly), “I know what your shirt is
        from… CATS!!!” He was so amused with himself and it was impossible not
        to laugh with him. I'll forever miss how kind, silly, ridiculous, and
        energetic he was. - Alysa Obertas
      </p> <p>
        “ Jing was one of the very first few people I acquainted with at CITA.
        We quickly became friends after my first few months working there. He
        was outgoing, extrovert, generous, and kind. He looked carefree from
        the outside but was actually sensitive and caring inside, and always
        knew how to stand in other people's shoes. He was a great colleague
        and a loyal friend. He was slightly older than me and was truly an
        older brother to me. He had never been an overbearing person even
        though he had achieved so much as a researcher; he had never ever been
        even a little bit patronizing though he was older and had more
        experiences than me. He had always been optimistic, warm, amicable,
        and loving. I am not an astrophysicist and helped with the
        administrative work at CITA. Since I have a background in arts instead
        of science, I constantly struggled at work at the beginning. Jing was
        my go-to person when I had problems. He was extremely patient and
        respectful. He never sent me away even when my questions and concerns
        were nothing but burdens to him. He helped me through my entire
        working time at CITA and always got everyone together for dinners and
        parties. At all those gatherings, he was always the person who took
        care of everything and was always generous to his friends and
        colleagues. In comparison, I was such a mediocre friend who barely
        provided any support to him during the Covid! Even after I left CITA,
        Jing did not become a stranger and continued to be a close friend to
        me. He certainly deserved a longer life and youth. I know if he had a
        few more decades of life, he would continue to be a good friend, a
        good colleague, and a good astrophysicist; he would continue to be a
        remarkable son to his parents, and if he had a family of his own, he
        would be a loving father to his children and a caring husband to his
        partner. He would continue to have a fulfilling life and a unique
        soul. Science is materialist. But I wish another life for Jing, even
        though reincarnation is contradictory to the scientific belief hold by
        many beloving astrophysicists. Jing had many wishes. He wanted to go
        to the Mars. I wish he would be able to achieve all those wishes, one
        by one, in another life.” — Jade Yujia Shi
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was always one of those people I looked forward to seeing at a
        meeting or conference. He never had any airs about him, was always
        welcoming, positive, and kind, and was genuinely fun to be around. I
        hope that we can look to his example in our own lives and try to live
        up to that ideal. I will miss him.” - Froney Crawford
      </p> <p>
        “Jing's one of the first pulsar people I met. We did our GBT observer
        training together and I'm still curious how he convinced their guide
        to let his group take pictures standing on the dish. He's been a
        welcome voice of humour and insight on telecons, and someone I got
        excited to see when I heard he was going to a conference. Nothing can
        make this better but I hope it's some solace to know that other people
        saw he was a good man and miss him too. He deserved so many more years
        in the world, and the world would have been better for it.
      </p> <p>
        Jing and I didn't quite connect sometimes, but we muddled through with
        lots of laughs along the way. I remember an incident early on at a
        conference. Jing approached and asked me if it was true that English
        people put milk in their tea (from his face it was clear he either
        thought it was a strangely widespread myth or evidence that we are all
        aliens). I confirmed that we did and said he should try it, not
        realizing that to me “tea” meant black tea and to him “tea” meant
        green tea. He looked very skeptical and said I'd have to show him how
        to do it. Next coffee-break he approached with a cup of tea and one of
        those tiny cups of milk, clearly expecting some secret trick to
        transform this concoction into something drinkable. He tried it, his
        face dropped, and he tried to be diplomatic before laughing and
        breaking into “you English have very strange tastes!!”. I tried it (I
        can confirm that milk and green tea do not go well together!), we
        realized our mistake and more laughter ensued. He made a tea reference
        at every conference for years afterwards.

        One particular Jing-moment keeps going round in my head. I have a NASA
        sticker on my laptop from Jing. When he gave it to me he grinned and
        said he loved having them because everyone always wants one. He was so
        happy to have something to give to other people. I hope to be more
        like him.” - Kathryn Crowter
      </p> <p>
        I had the pleasure of knowing Jing for many years, at least since
        2011. What a super-smart, delightful, zany human being! Jing
        personified loving life and sharing that love with all around him. You
        just couldn't have a bad time if Jing was in the room. But, of course,
        he had a serious and dedicated side, too. What he did for pulsar
        timing with PINT is and will continue to be a gigantic contribution to
        the work that we do. He was wonderfully proud of his work, as he
        should have been. He loved the pulsar community, and he had certainly
        found a place for himself with the Toronto group. What a gigantic loss
        to everyone who knew him. Our hearts go out to his family who did not
        get to see him very much in recent years. Know that he was loved by
        many and that we will find ways of keeping his memory alive and
        passing on his legacy to others. -- Dan Stinebring
      </p> <p>
        Jing was a ray of sunshine in all of our lives. He had the rare talent
        of being able to bring any group of people together and brighten the
        mood in a room, just by the power of his presence. His passion for
        sampling everything life has to offer was inspirational. At all times,
        he was just off from a fresh experience. Visiting a baseball game,
        making a trip to Niagara Falls, buying an old video camera in a garage
        sale.. There are too many to count - he really lived his life to the
        fullest. Jing was unbelievably kind, always offering his help and
        advice and never expecting anything in return. He was an incredible
        storyteller and it was so nice to listen to his stories and opinions.
        It has been a privilege knowing Jing and I am missing him greatly. It
        is a terrible, terrible loss for the world. -- Pavel Motloch
      </p> <p>
        I did not know Jing well but I knew of him by his excellent scientific
        reputation. I heard his name over and over in meetings and
        conversations about pulsar timing. He was clearly a world class expert
        who was admired by so many people. He was a brilliant scientist who
        was highly respected by his peers. I am so sorry I will never have the
        chance to talk with him. It is a horrible loss and a terrible tragedy
        that he was taken so young, in his prime, with so much promise. I feel
        heartbroken for his family and friends. -- VIctoria Kaspi
      </p> <p>
        “I met Jing at the IPTA meeting in Thailand in 2013. He was
        immediately likable and over the years I never saw him without a smile
        on his face. A great loss to the world. So very sad.” - Paul Brook.
      </p> <p>
        “Jing was an absolutely unforgettable presence at CITA. I'll never
        forget how we used to joke about being hat-wearers in the building,
        and about how he roped me into a 'prank' where we swapped out
        everyone's photographs for drawings. Jing was always very humble, yet
        funny, adding his own self-portrait to the board with his iconic hat.
        He gifted me with a Van Gogh magnet, with a hat, that I still have on
        my board at home, along with other treasures from friends. I wish I
        could tell him that I treasured that, and that he was a treasure in
        all aspects of his presence. Rest well, space cowboy.” - Emily Tyhurst
      </p> <p>
        So sad, so sad. A recurring memory is of Jing's beaming presence in
        the coffee room, especially at CITA desserts. Jing exuded a unique
        joie de vivre. Matching his majestic hat, Jing had an outsized ability
        to listen, care, and befriend. What a terrible loss, for his community
        of colleagues and friends, and the more so for his family. I will
        remember his great humanity. (Virtual) hugs to all in this time of
        grieving. - Peter Martin
      </p> <p>
        I first met Jing when he came to the US for his Masters. He was a
        goofy kid and instantly made buddies with everyone around with his
        super friendly nature. He and I became very close friends, first as
        classmates and then as flatmates, and it was an absolute joy being
        around him. We were both wide eyed young lads in a foreign land and
        were there for each other on so many occasions, enjoying Lord of the
        Rings and Galaxy Quest on our super comfortable sofas, playing
        Borderlands on our PS4 after a long day at work, crying over breakups
        with girlfriends and problems at work, nerding over Elon Musk, sharing
        our dinners and our dreams. I learnt so much from him. He was a
        friend, a mentor, and an inspiration to me. I owe my sanity during PhD
        to his friendship. We kept meeting even after moving out of grad
        school, in China, in Germany. I cannot believe that he is not around.
        I will always miss him… -- Sourabh
      </p> <p>
        I am so shocked to hear this. Santiago was a very familiar face to the
        Forró group, always willing to learn new moves and try them out. At
        our last class in December, he and I were joking around and I
        attempted to lead him in the dance and he tried following, despite him
        being a foot taller than me. One move involved the lead letting go of
        the follower, and the follow raising their hands above their head, and
        we attempted it, but we were messing up so bad and we had to stop
        dancing because we were laughing SO hard! You'll be greatly missed, Dr
        Santiago. - Sal
      </p> <p>
        I remember when I started at CITA in late 2019, Jing was one of those
        people who you could immediately tell was adored by everyone. He was
        confident, competent and welcoming, and he seemed to bring a smile
        with him wherever he went. I'm grateful to have gotten to know him and
        for those few welcome moments of normalcy over the last few years at
        CITA desserts, seminars and group lunches. Jing was someone whose
        presence was undeniable at CITA, you just knew he belonged, and he
        made you feel like you did too. It won't be quite the same without
        him. My condolences to his family and friends. - Nathan Carlson
      </p> <p>
        Santiago, from the bottom of my heart.. It was a pleasure to have met
        you. You were one of the kindest people I had the honour of meeting.
        Every time I saw you, you were always smiling no matter what
        situation. Thank you for tolerating my spontaneous visits to your
        house and my mediocre dancing skills. Thank you for teaching me about
        the stars and the galaxies. Thank you for letting me be a part of your
        life. Your time here is done, but I know we will meet again soon, so
        till then… I'll be looking forward to being your dance partner again.
        - Jordan
      </p> <p>
        I knew Jing through my roommate Jade. Quickly he became a vibrant part
        of our friend group and we enjoyed a lot of nice hangouts together. I
        remember the first time I met Jing, when we parted ways to go home I
        fell off my bike. Of course Jing then biked with me and my bleeding
        knee all the way home, even though it was in the opposite direction
        for him. Jing was always so kind and had a wonderful smile and energy
        that could make anyone feel happy. I wish he was still here. We are
        all so lucky to have known him. - Emily Lawrence
      </p> <p>
        Jing Santiago started attending Forró dance classes around 4 years
        ago, in 2018. He was very eager to learn, sometimes he would joke he
        was nervous dancing with me "as one of the instructos". He loved to
        make people smile while dancing, always with a big smile and a
        compliment. He attended our special events (during our Saint John
        party with his cowboy hat and some mustaches he shared with others at
        the party) and workshops as much as his career and family visits
        allowed him. It was shocking to our community to learn this sad news.
        Last I saw Santiago was on December 2021, when we restarted in person
        classes. One class he brought 2 friends, who were very kind to inform
        us by e-mail about this sad news. We danced a lot and he forgot his
        backpack in class, than had to pick it up at my place the next day. He
        was always the light of the event, being dancing or any other social
        activity after class. Santiago was full of life and kindness, always
        welcoming people and sharing his love for life. Our prays are with his
        family and friends - Maristela
      </p> <p>
        I met Jing when I came to CITA for an internship over the summer. We
        went on a trip with our group to Algonquin to install a Christmas tree
        feed. He designed a logo and printed badges for us, like we were a
        squad on a special mission, it was really funny. (I still wear this
        badge proudly on my backpack!) One evening, a few of us went with him
        on a canoe and crossed the entire lake there and back. We could see
        the Milky Way so clearly, and the telescope dish in the distance. This
        was one night I will never forget. It happened because Jing suggested
        we go on the canoe. Another evening, after everybody went to sleep, he
        and I stayed awake and chatted for a long time. After that night, I
        felt like I met a new best friend. All of my best memories from that
        summer include him. He made me feel extremely welcome in an
        environment where I felt very alone and foreign. My stay in Toronto
        was brief, and I did not get to spend nearly as much time with him as
        I hoped. My condolences to his family and friends. - Daniela Breitman
      </p> <p>
        At dance events in the forro community in Toronto, Jing/Santiago was
        always one of my favorite dance partners. He started each dance with a
        huge smile and warm greeting, and his lively spirit created a joyful
        atmosphere in every dance we shared - regardless of whether or not we
        got the dance moves correct. He was also very earnest in trying to
        learn difficult dance sequences - I remember trying to learn one with
        him in November 2021, and we had to stop dancing because we were
        laughing too much together. To me he felt like a true gentleman who
        treated each dance partner with care. I think his passing is all the
        more heartbreaking because he was not someone simply going through the
        motions of life - it felt like he tried to truly enjoy and make the
        most of each moment and relationship he had. I wish he could have had
        more time. I send heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. -

        “我很难表达我对靖的去世感到多么难过。每次遇见他,他的脸上总是挂着灿烂的笑容,总让我觉得不得不交换一两个愚蠢的笑话。
        我记得他刚来的时总喜欢戴着一顶疯狂的牛仔帽在楼道里闲逛。我问他这是怎么回事,他和我说了些他在德克萨斯州布朗斯维尔的一些往事。作为刚来加拿大的中国人,一切都是新奇的,但很快他和新朋友们打成了一片。朋友们帮助骆靖安顿下来,并开始叫他圣地亚哥。他很满意这个新名字。那顶牛仔帽子也成为了他的一项个人标志。他的门牌上写着
        Jing Santiago Luo
        （"骆--圣地亚哥--靖"）。他享受生活,享受和人们交往,是一个真正善良、有爱心的人。对于他去世的消息,我感到心碎,并会非常想念他。

        ——阿达泽·伊比克（Adaeze Ibik）
      </p> <p>
        “靖是一个有趣且富有魅力的人,他身边有许多有趣的故事。他曾用微波炉来加热支票本,他曾带他的妈妈去阿岗昆射电天文台（Algonquin）观测（他妈妈还帮房东的家人组装了一套乐高积木）,他曾为一起安装圣诞树养料的同伴起名“特遣队
        125” （“Taskforce
        125”）还为小队设计了专属徽章。我要感谢他让我走出舒适区去尝试新事物（比如彩弹射击）。我们会想念他的！”

        “骆靖的笑话和乐观态度是我喜欢去办公室的重要原因。每次遇到他,他一定会跟你打个招呼,讲个笑话,和嘘寒问暖。他总是通过他的方式,让所有人都融入到群体里,无论是招呼一起喝咖啡,还是组织大家一起活动（他因此而在星巴克获得了非常多的积分,有趣的是,他总是试着让咖啡师叫他火箭牛仔）。家庭日假期又快来了,我又记起
        2019
        年的时候,他组织大家一起热热闹闹地吃火锅,他让我们感觉不止是同事,而像是家人。非常非常想念他,一路走好,圣地亚哥（他自起的称谓,相当于老铁）。

        玩具枪,经常跟我们打成一片。即使是在疫情期间,办公楼都没啥人,只要我在办公室,他也会过来跟我打招呼。他是那么友好,热情和积极的一个人。很难相信他再也不会来敲我办公室的门,再也不会有热烈的讨论,再也不能一起打成一片了。同时,我也很庆幸能与他结识。我会非常想念你的。安息吧,骆靖”<br>

        “从他戴着标志性的大帽子（30
        升那么大）,大步走进多伦多的那一天起,骆靖就在着留下了烙印。他有超凡脱俗的魅力,他总是能找到他自己的方式,带大家的生活变得多姿多彩。无论是什么样的问题和挑战,只要跟他在一起,你就知道会有一个有趣的故事。他有一种特殊的天赋,能够激励人挑战常规,同时他也会帮你出谋划策去完成目标。这就是大家被他吸引的原因。当他从新人转变为社区的支柱时,你能感觉到他有意让每一个遇到他的人都感到受欢迎。每一次的欢快背后,不仅有滑稽的故事,或者有点不敬的笑话,还有他的善意和热情。这个世界没有了骆靖会变得更加单调；我们的人生则因为跟他有交集而变得更丰富。”

        “骆靖是我在多伦多大学最开始遇到的人之一。我记得跟他是在多伦多岛上的烧烤时认识的,他是我见过的最友好、最热情的人！在那之后,因为疫情的缘故,基本上都只能线上办公,我就只见过他几次,但是每次碰到的时候,他总是会来打招呼,并聊上一阵。他身体力行地让人觉地受欢迎,是圈子里的一部分。我会想你的,骆靖。我想要向骆靖的家人、朋友、同事以及所有认识他的人表示最诚挚的哀悼。”
        —— Gween Eadie Page 3: translated by Bo
        “当骆靖走进天文系教工办公室的时候,他总散发着温暖。他走过走廊时,常常和我们工作人员打招呼,也探头到我们办公室里寒暄。我总是享受和他闲聊。这些对话总让我的一天变得更好。我们最后其中一次聊天时聊到了他时髦的牛仔夹克。我注意到了夹克上有星球大战的刺绣。他非常激动,并告诉我更多关于这件衣服的事（比如他如何仔细地订制了这个图案,如何给这图案选地方）。我永远不会忘记他带给我的感觉。两年的防疫和社交距离很折磨人。但是在这短暂的对话中,我清晰地记得我这么想：“这种氛围正是我想念回办公室工作的原因”。骆靖,

        ARO Kotekan
        系统,每当我遇到困难时,他总是为我提供指导和建议。他让像我这样的新人在科研旅途中感到更加自在；我会记住他的重力/反重力球问题。感谢骆靖为推进脉冲星研究领域所做的一切努力,也感谢他让每个人都感到受欢迎和开心。”

        的一次旅行中认识他的。虽然我以前从未见过他,但他已经把我当成了他最好的朋友。旅途中,我们分享了无数的欢笑。之后的几个月里,他会经常来我们的实验室作客,我们总是玩得很开心。记得在疫情开始前不久,他从开学术会议回来,带了许多纪念品（蟹状星云的照片）送给大家。收到这份礼物,我当时感到非常开心。他知道如何让人们开心到发笑,每个与他接触过的人都喜欢他。他也会发自内心的去关心身边的每一个人。他会永远被铭记在心。”

        12
        层,我很吃惊的发现天文系的大部分行政人员都很熟悉他。这说明他很愿意花时间去认识和了解每个人。和骆靖聊天是每天的一大亮点。失去他是对多伦多大学天文系来说是一个可悲的损失。我永远不会忘记在他与我们相处期间的所有令人难忘的交流,可惜这些交流都太短暂了。

        “在 2017 年我第一次访问 CITA
        时,骆靖接待了我,并带我们在多伦多唐人街的一家餐厅吃了无比美味的一顿饭。骆靖有能力给任何一群人带来真正的温暖和幸福,那天晚上他让我们笑得合不拢嘴。自从搬到多伦多后,我意识到骆靖无论在哪里都会保持这样的快乐和开朗。每次我在

        （NANOGrav）和加拿大氢强度测绘实验
        （CHIME）的项目）有非常密切的合作。他是一位出色的合作者,且拥有非常美丽动容的品格。他热爱生命,科学,
        还有脉冲星（耶！）,并且对任何事情都只有积极乐观的看法。我通常是一个非常坚忍的人,但听到骆靖的死,我真的很难受。这证明了他是一个多么可爱的人,以及他过早的离世是多么的糟糕。我会非常想念他。干杯,靖。”

        “骆靖总会找到一些有趣且令人兴奋的事或物。我最喜欢的故事之一是他在某次
        CITA 甜点时间跑进办公室,说'嘿！我的办公室里有鬼！”
        靖发现如果你按他办公室的黑板,大厅另一侧的一间办公室会有声响,并坚称这是鬼。可当我跟着他到办公室时,他兴奋地走到黑板前,期待地看着我,继续按着黑板,什么也没发生。
        '你没听见鬼吗？！',
        '没有。'我回答道。他继续按压黑板的其他位置,再次说'你现在听到了吗？现在怎么样？
        这个呢？'
        “还是没有,你知道我认为你要疯了,对吧？”我回答道。他不停地按,直到从大厅里突然传来一声响动,他脱口而出：“来了！有鬼！'我们来来回回研究了足足十五分钟,让'鬼'出现。这十五分钟的研究成功令我和靖坚定相信有“鬼魂”的存在。后来,我和靖一起回到
        CITA 休息室,将这个关于黑板鬼的事告诉了 CITA
        的其他人。我已经开始想念靖了,想念他在系里是如此的不可缺少。没有他,这个世界将是一个更悲伤的地方”

        他很快就成为了我期待在这些会议上见到的人之一,他总是风趣善良,经常用我的母语和我打招呼（其中有不少还是他让我教他的）。
        我们在一起的时候总是有很多欢声笑语,他真的让那些时光变得轻松、友好。
        他带给我印象最深的一件事之一是他为 IPTA
        会议的学生周准备的一个关于平方千米阵（下一代世界最巨型的射电望远镜阵列,SKA）的简短演讲,他在演讲里很有趣地联动了作为望远镜的

        的同事们计划一次有趣的活动,来为经历了长达两年疫情生活的大家振奋精神（这很符合他的风格）。我给出了一点微不足道的建议,但他非常感激,坚持要这周要款待我去

        骆靖是一个聪明、友善,也非常有趣的人。他是我最亲密的朋友之一,也是真正的知己。我有幸在很年轻的时候就认识他,他是我上学时的导师。我们常常谈论如何超越我们自己,如何改变世界,如何教育下一代学生。靖的生活很丰富多彩,他也让我的生活变得丰富。我们有幸一起旅行：去巴黎、马来西亚和美国。当我去加拿大拜访他时,我们穿越了阿尔伯塔省。好几次他突然在瑟瑟寒风中突然停下,说是要拍银河,亦或是他发现了一个绝佳的拍摄火车的角度。他忠于自己的热情,对自己有很高的要求,并常常激励我也这样做。写到这里,悲伤让我难以提笔,我无法用言语表达这种失落的感受。真的,我现在根本写不下任何安慰的话语,但我知道我的生活因为认识了靖而变得更加美好。让我们把骆靖的友善,和蔼以及仁爱传承下去,作为对他这个好人的最好纪念,直到我们再次见到他,亲爱的靖·

        "骆靖学长可能是我在美国遇到的第一个人。我刚到德州下飞机的时候,就是他和栋铭学长、王炎学长一起来接的我。他热情地接待了我,照顾我在新大陆开始新的生活。在德州生活的两年里,我和骆靖学长有很多愉快的回忆。我们坐在同一个办公室工作,一起吃饭,听报告,玩游戏,他像家人一样照顾我。我还记得我们（和栋铭学长、文慧学姐四人一起）放春假去墨西哥看金字塔,那可能是我在德州的两年玩得最开心的一次了。我也还记得骆靖学长的爸妈来看他时,我们三天两头往他家跑,叔叔阿姨做了好多好吃的。
        骆靖学长永远充满正能量,交际技能点满,能快速和任何人熟悉起来。他也热心公益和组织活动,我的硕士毕业烧烤就是他组织的。那之后,我到纽约读博,我们的联系逐渐变少了。不过我仍记得他帮我解释了一篇他的论文,让我在第二天的研讨课上表现得很好,还以此拿到了老师的推荐信。我最后一次见到骆靖学长大概是在
        2019 年初,他来纽约开会,顺便到我的住处小聚。我们在他最喜欢的 Five
        Guys
        餐厅吃了晚饭,谈天说地,缅怀过往,好不痛快。他只留宿了一晚,可惜的是第二天我的一个朋友出了一点急事,我没能送他去火车站。想不到这一别竟是永远。我多希望那天我送他去了车站,好好地道别！我会永远记住骆靖,我的学长、朋友、大哥！"

        年底新冠疫情爆发前我最后一起出去玩的人之一。当时靖刚从中国回来,邀请我一起去看电影和溜冰。这对我非常重要,因为在当时我刚来多伦多,在这里并不认识太多的朋友。这些经历对我之后度过新冠非常重要。我会时常回忆起他指导我关于脉冲星和闪烁[现象]（scintillation）的那些对话和时光。

        （和上一页一条重复） 骆靖的办公室和我的办公室不在同一栋楼里,

        骆靖是我在疫情期间来到多伦多最初在 CITA 认识的几个朋友之一。
        我记得疫情缓和以后,他是最经常拜访我办公室的伙伴之一
        （但是他其实一直找的是我的办公室室友
        Antoine,真是很让我嫉妒！）我们一起吃午餐的时光总是充满欢乐。他仿佛是对多伦多所有的好餐馆如数家珍。去年秋天,他组织了在
        Barrie
        的一场彩蛋射击比赛,这让我们许多同事都非常高兴。我不清楚这之前我已经有多少年没有玩过彩蛋射击了。我们在讨论今年冬季能够一起再去第二次,可以在下雪天一起玩射击。但是我们最终未能实现计划。我感觉他是个非常特别的人。他知识渊博又富有极强的幽默感。我会和很多人一样想念他。我非常高兴能够在这里认识他。我作为他的同事和朋友为他感到骄傲。

        Baldwin 街的 Koh Lipe Thai
        餐厅和其他中国学生们一起聚餐。他风趣地给我们介绍泰国菜,给我们讲德州和多伦多的区别,还有那些
        CHIME
        （加拿大氢强度测绘实验）的新发现。我当时好奇地问他,为什么取了一个
        'Santiago'
        （圣地亚哥）的英文名字；他狡黠地一笑,然后给我们看他戴着那顶标志性帽子的照片。我拎着行李准备聚完餐后去机场,他扬手祝我一路顺风,想不到却成为最后一面。骆学长,希望您一路走好。

        骆靖有着一种难以抑制的喜悦感和活力。无论在什么聚会场合,他总会占据中心位置,用他那些离奇的故事来活跃气氛。他是一个非常全面的人,从不回避挑战,并且总是渴望伸出援助之手。疫情开始之前,我们在
        CITA 和
        AAS（美国天文学会）会议上一同度过了很多难忘的日子。疫情期间,我们仍继续保持着联系。他走了,我感到非常难过。这世间不仅失去了一位才华横溢的科学家,更失去了一位善良开朗的人。

        年多伦多岛的夏季烧烤会上,他是那么热情和包容。尽管彼此不太熟识,他却会答应在假期照看我的宠物猫,以便令我能回家看望亲人,而且他还会每天发来小猫探险的照片让我安心。后来的
        2020 年初,他去 AAS
        开会,并从一家参展商那里带了件太空猫别针送给我,这让我感到万分惊喜。直到今天,这份礼物还挂在我背包很显眼的位置上。没有言语能够充分表达我对他去世所感到的悲伤。我很庆幸认识他,又很遗憾认识他的时间这么短。这世界曾因他的存在而更加美好。愿你安息,靖。”

        的闪烁计量（scintillometry）组,我们一直密切地在各种项目中合作,其中大部分项目都很复杂并且会用到好几个望远镜。靖出色的沟通能力和友善的性格使这些项目的协调十分顺利。工作之余,靖亦为人大方,待人友善。他会从他的厨师朋友那请教菜谱,烹饪许多美味佳肴,然后邀请朋友与自己一同享用。我至今还记得他用奶酪和酸醋烤制的波塔贝罗蘑菇,还有美味的烤虾！此外,帮助别人似乎是他的日常。我记得他帮过许多包括我在内的
        CITA
        人搬家。在过去几年的里,我们在多伦多度过了一段非常愉快的时光。我将永远记住那些珍贵的时刻。谢谢你,靖,愿你安息。”

        我是在读本科时认识的骆靖。那是 2019
        年,他来德克萨斯大学大河谷分校大学（UTRGV）学术访问几天。我们共同的朋友介绍我们认识,当我问起他的名字时,他让我只叫他“太空牛仔”（space
        cowboy）就好,我是后来才得知他的全名。与他相识时间不长,但他是我见过最友善、最外向、最有趣的人。在共事的那短短的几天里,他会提议请我和我的朋友喝星巴克咖啡,来作为努力学习的奖励,还会给我们讲许许多多的知识点和笑话。在他回加拿大后,我们仍然通过社交媒体保持着联系。
        靖非常聪明,他总是积极的,而且总是知道如何让身边的人感到舒适和被他欢迎。他会打破你个人空间的隔阂,让你感到被包容,让你知道他是你想成为朋友的那类人。我将永远铭记他的善意。下回见,靖！

        除此之外,他还是我的导师和主管--我从他身上学到了很多东西--是对我最有启发的科学家。在
        CITA 的整个期间,我和靖成为了亲密的朋友。
        他总是让我笑,而且有最好的笑话。他是一个令人振奋的人,如果你有一个糟糕的一天,靖总是会确保你在一天结束时脸上有一个微笑。
        他总是喜欢新的冒险--总是对新的体验说好,我的意思是他搬家是跨国式的！他第一次尝试滑冰,并通过他的摄影作品享受他周围的美景。我们甚至计划不久后进行一次远足！他是一个内外兼修的人。
        一个从内到外都很美的人。他用他的存在给他周围的人带来光明。我们很幸运能拥有他,我永远感激。我永远不会忘记你的教诲和友谊。我将永远把你留在我的心里和脑海中。"

        的走廊上和休息室里碰见他都是相当欢乐有趣的。他曾在我们打招呼的时候便扔给我一块巧克力。他那乐於分享、令人振奋的精神也提升了我的能量,而他分享的巧克力更为我的研究提供了动力。谢谢你,骆靖,感谢你不單在脉冲星、快速電波爆發和闪烁体探测等科學研究項目有直接的貢獻,对最大尺度的磁电离宇宙研究也有间接的贡献呢！
        我还记得在去年的圣诞聚会后与骆靖有趣而有意义的聊天。我们走过多伦多大学的校园,聊着细碎随意的事,也聊着大而深的话题（例如东西方的文化；怎样让研究环境对每个人来说都变得更好更理想）。当我和靖向北走时,我们碰到了另一位
        CITA 博士后 Pavel。Pavel
        那時正向南走去,沿途寻找他的手套。这是一个寒冷的夜晚,但没有什么能阻止我们仨人站在寒风中聊天,并确认大家都平安快乐。这是一个寒冷的夜晚,但我们的谈话却充满了温暖,所谈的是关于我们所关心的群体,所谈的也关于平常卻也美好的生活。骆靖是一颗明星,闪耀着光芒,向他周围的人和其他人散发着温暖。能够成为他的同事,我感到非常幸运。我衷心地感谢

        "当我回顾我迄今为止的职业生涯时,我通常会想到骆靖。他是我开始参加我们的脉冲星科学领域的国际会议时最早遇到的人之一。靖的幽默和存在感总是给我留下标志性的印象。他的友善、欢迎周围每个人的能力和才智出众與这个标志完美匹配。我总是能指望骆靖会参加下一个会议,准备好一起去吃东西和喝啤酒,在一整天的工作后召集共同的朋友一起休息,并完成好工作。我记得有一次,我和靖参加了
        2014
        年在阿尔伯塔省班夫举行的国际脉冲星会议,我们在离开会议设施前往市中心与朋友聚会时遇到了一只
        "阿尔法麋鹿"！我们只能静静地站在那里,对这只巨大的麋鹿感到敬畏。而它也只是反过来盯着我们看,一两分钟后才离开。然后我们进行了一个美妙的的晚餐和卡拉
        OK 之夜。每当我们用纳米赫兹的频率探测到引力波时,都会有靖的贡献在其中
        -
        是靖的工作来幫助我們发现這些引力波的。你是一个传奇,骆靖。我会想念你的。"

        “骆靖是每位科学家都可以用来激励和鼓励他人努力工作的好榜样。射电天文学正在经历一场革命,而靖曾如此热情地推动着这场革命向前发展。我很难过于他如今无法看到他所有的劳动成果,也没有机会成为他极有可能注定要成为的领导者。与靖交谈一直是我在
        CITA
        工作的乐趣之一,或仅仅是在多伦多附近的街道上漫步——就像许多有魅力的人一样,他似乎有着无处不在的能力,总是殷切打听和传播那些最新消息。我向他的家人表示最深切的哀悼,也向所有与他密切合作的人表示最深切的哀悼。”
        ——克里斯·汤普森（Chris Thompson）
      </p> <p>
        “听到这个消息,我感到非常难过和震惊。靖是一个好朋友,我将永远铭记有关于他的那些美好回忆。他的办公室就在我的旁边,他经常来我们办公室聊天,还会借走那些玩具枪,然后总是会在我们不经意间把它们还回来。他非常友好,当我在
        2019
        年作以国际学生的身份搬来多伦多时,他让我在这里感到非常受欢迎,我将永远为此心存感激。他与许多研究生交好,我们经常称他为“荣誉”研究生,因为他会参加我们的聚会和郊游,他在场的情况下总会使得氛围更加活跃。他也非常敬业、勤奋、体贴。记得
        2019 年 12 月,物理楼（MP Building）空荡无人的时候,12
        楼只有我和靖。我们在圣诞节前夕和当天出去庆祝,因为我俩可能是多伦多仅剩的不在庆祝圣诞节的人。寒假期间我一个人在多伦多时,他让我的假期变得更加热闹,我将永远感谢他的陪伴。安息吧,靖。我希望你的家人如此黑暗的时刻能找寻到力量。”

        “我在本科刚开始脉冲星研究时认识了靖（我目前正在完成我的博士论文）,从那以后他一直是我最喜欢的合作者之一。他的积极、善良、热情和幽默照亮了他所在的每个房间,我一直期待在会议上见到他。虽然我不常与他直接合作,但在我的整个职业生涯中,我们一直保持着联系,他的指导和乐于回答任何问题（即使这是我第五次询问如何将内容推送到网上
        GitHub
        存储库……）总会使事情变得更好。他不仅做出了对北美纳赫兹引力波天文台（NANOGrav）科学有帮助并令人惊叹的工作,而且还以他积极的态度和对科学的热情使那些合作变得更好。我会时常怀念你的,靖。”

        “每当有人关心骆靖是谁,我都发现难以用简单的语言去描述。每一次到最后,我都只能简单的说他是我眼里从中国来的最棒的德州牛仔。骆靖有着非常地道的德州人的气质。他总是能用不可预知的方式令人开怀。一开始你可能不知道他在讲什么,但是他的故事的结尾总是会峰回路转,令人捧腹。他跟我们一样都是常人,但他跟我们不同的是他有一颗热情的心。我记得,疫情刚刚开始的时候,因为有很多学院地事情要忙,我有些焦虑,骆靖特意放下他手头地工作来安慰我,直到我放宽心。我会一直纪念骆靖这个同事兼好友。”

        “我在
        CITA（骆靖工作的单位）第一次见到骆靖的记忆依然栩栩如生。他戴着他的德州牛仔帽坐在会议室的情形,一下子就让我觉得很亲近。他很快就成为了我的良师益友。骆靖是一个非常热情好客的人,他对生活的热情非常有感染力。我很幸运有机会跟他一起去阿冈昆（加拿大的一个地方）做观测,我从他身上学到了很多的知识。骆靖非常喜欢探险,跟他一起划独木舟去探索湖的尽头是我永远都难以忘怀的记忆。以前我们每周都一起吃午饭,开玩笑。即使后来我离开了
        CITA,骆靖也一直跟我保持联系。他是一位挚友,是一个总是散发正能量,令人心情愉悦的存在。我会非常想念你的,骆靖。”<br>

        “骆靖是我在天文系最开始遇到的人之一。有一次,我们在视频会议的空挡,恰好聊到了读过的科幻小说,发现我们都有这一个共同爱好。我们后来还一起聊了好多次小说和天文。他总是那么的热情和友好,我们无话不谈。虽然我们相交甚短,但我永远都会怀念他和与他聊天的快乐。”
        —— Daniella Morrone
      </p> <p>
        “骆靖或者说
        Santiago（圣地亚哥）可能是我交过的最有德州风情的朋友。他是一个风趣的人,有着各种各样的故事和经历。无论是德州的趣事,还是他野外探索时的照片,或者是疫情之后他跟他的健身房朋友们一起在加拿大的寒冬里锻炼的非凡经历,他都非常乐于分享。他是我见过的最有胸怀的人,会把每一个人都放在心上。他一直以来都对人很好,尽心尽力地创造机会让大家成为朋友。他总是把友谊放在第一位。仅仅是跟他认识几个月之后,他就会跟你打成一片,开始讨论一起美国去公路旅行。真希望他还能继续他的探险,并结识更多的人。
        我想分享一个体现他充满善意的灵魂的故事。有一天早上,当我步行去办公室时,遇上了骑着自行车的他。他就停下来跟我打招呼,然后就像骑自行车的圣诞老人一样,随手从包里拿出他最近去纽约旅行时从大都会博物馆买的艺术书签,说“这些是给你的”。聊了几分钟后,他就骑车走了,但这友善的行为和他的灿烂笑容让我余下的一天都充满了阳光。在新冠疫情的最初几个月,当我还在美国的家中时,他经常给我发表情包,以及多伦多初春时的鲜花的照片。这些点点滴滴让我在孤独的时光里感到了温暖。今年生日过后几天,我在办公室的桌上看到有一份礼物。我预感到它是骆靖送的。我给他发信息问他知不知道这是谁送的,他打趣地回答道：“请你转告
        Martine,是我送的。”礼物是一个装有葵花籽的水培花盆。我已经种上了,我希望我还能向他展示它们生长时的样子。我会珍惜和他一起探索多伦多、跳舞、参加系里活动、喝咖啡和在大厅里聊天的回忆。谢谢你所做的一切,骆靖。我会想念你的”

        “骆靖是我一位非常亲密的朋友。他在哪里都充满了令人难以置信的热情和活力。只要有团体郊游,他都会参加。他参加派对、去看芭蕾舞、参与节日、逛市场等各种活动,都给我留下了那么美好的记忆。他总是努力去了解我的朋友。即使是那些只见过他一两次的人,也清楚地记得他。他就是这样——他的活力和性格给每个人留下了如此深刻的印象。当我开始穿足尖鞋训练时,他积极地鼓励我,也为我激动。当我在社交媒体上发布视频或照片时,他总是发消息表示支持。几年前他去
        AAS（美国天文学会年会）的时候,还给我带回来了一个很可爱的猫别针。我从那以后一直把它别在我的舞包上！我最喜欢的关于他的一段回忆发生在
        CITA 甜点茶会上。我那时穿着一件 T 恤,上面印有 Joy Division 乐队
        《Unknown Pleasures》专辑封面上的 pulsar
        图案,不过改成了猫。他（洋洋得意地）对我说：'我知道你的 T
        恤图案从哪来...《猫》（音乐剧）！！！'他被自己逗乐了,而我也强行被他的笑声感染了。我将永远怀念他的善良、憨厚、滑稽和活力。”

      </p> <p>
        骆靖是我在 CITA
        最早认识的几个人之一。在工作一段时间以后,我们很快成为了朋友。他开朗、活泼、大方、善良,外表随和爽朗,内心却细腻丰富,很能为别人着想,也从不在小事上计较得失,是个难得的好工作伙伴,也是一位难得的挚友。我不是天文物理学家,只是在
        CITA
        做行政工作的职员。因为是文科的背景,所以工作上还是有很多的困难。每一次遇到大小的问题,我都会去找骆靖。他很耐心,也很尊重人,从来不因为我的牢骚和他本人的工作和生活无关就不以为意。他比我年长几岁,很有大哥哥的风度,每每在我遇到各种困难的时候替我解围,替我分忧,总在有空的时候组织我和其他的朋友聚会,也从不在这些事情的花费上计较。相比起来,我作为他的朋友实在不够好,在疫情期间都没有给予他应有的支持。后来即便我离开了
        CITA
        继续我的学业,骆靖也没有疏远我。他从来不因为自己的成绩骄傲,也从来不因为别人年轻不懂事就计较。他永远是积极的,温暖的,与人为善的,包容的。
        骆靖值得更长久的生命和青春。我知道如果他如果再有几十年的生命,他一定仍旧会是一个好朋友,好同事,好天文物理学家；对于他的父母,他会是个出色的儿子；如果他有了自己家庭,也会是一个好父亲,好丈夫。他会继续拥有一个如此特别的灵魂和充实的生命。科学家是唯物的,但我相信骆靖还能有来世,即便这和天文物理学家的世界观是冲突的。他还有很多未竟的心愿,他还想去火星。如果有来世,希望他如愿。

        “骆靖一直是我期待在讨论会或者会议上见到的那些人之一。

        “骆靖是我遇到的第一批脉冲星研究者之一。
        我们一起参加了格林班克望远镜（GBT）观测员培训,我至今仍然好奇他是如何说服向导让他的团队站在望远镜天线上拍照的。在视频会议上,他一直因幽默和睿智而广受欢迎；每当听说他要出席某个会议时,我会很期待见到他。
        他的去世所带来的心碎难以缓解,但大家都了解他高尚的为人并且也非常想念他,我希望这可以成为（大家的心灵）得到慰藉的方法。
        他应该在这个世上再多待些年岁,世界会因他的存在而变得更加美好。
      </p> <p>
        骆靖和我有时性格不大相和,但是我们仍充满欢笑地一起走过难关。我记得早前在一次会议上的一件事。骆靖走过来问我,英国人喝茶加牛奶,是不是真的（他脸上的表情很明显在说,这件事要么是广泛流传的谣言,要么证明我们英国人都是外星人）。我证实说有这一回事,而且说他也该试试这么喝茶,但我没意识到我说的“茶”指的是红茶,而他说的“茶”是绿茶。他满脸怀疑地说我得教他怎么喝。下一次茶歇时,他端着一杯茶、拿着一小壶奶来找我,很明显期待着什么能把这奇怪组合变得可口的秘诀。他尝了一口奶茶,脸色失望,试着找委婉的词句。最后他大笑着说“你们英国人口味太奇怪了！！”
        我尝了一口他的茶（能证实绿茶加奶的确难喝！）,我们俩才意识到我们的误会,于是又一块大笑。后来几年每次开会他都会提茶的事。
      </p> <p>
        我脑子里总想着一个特别骆靖的事。我电脑上一个
        NASA（美国国家航空航天局）的贴纸是他送的。他给我的时候咧嘴笑着说他特别喜欢买这个贴纸,因为所有人都想要一个。为别人付出能让他那么开心。我希望我能成为一个更像他的人”。

        从 2011
        年起我就有幸和骆靖相识。他是超级聪明、愉快、幽默的一个人。骆靖代表了热爱生活、并和周围人分享的态度。如果你在他身边,你就不可能不开心。不过,当然,他也有严肃、敏感的一面。他对使用
        PINT
        工具进行脉冲星计时的工作,已经是、也将一直是我们领域的巨大贡献。他对自己的工作充满应得的骄傲。他热爱脉冲星研究的社区,也在多伦多的脉冲星组找到了自己的位置。我们的心与他的家人们同在,他们这些年很少见到他。请相信他受到了很多人的喜爱,而我们也会铭记他,并把他的研究遗产发扬光大。——丹·斯廷布林

        “骆靖时我们生命里的一束光,他有着一种难能可贵的天赋,能够将任何一群人聚集在一起,只需要有他存在,就能活跃房间里的气氛。他对生活里任何一件事都具有无比的热情,令人深受启发。在任何时候,他都保持着初心。参观棒球比赛,参观尼亚加拉大瀑布,或者在旧货市场买旧摄像机。他真正地把生活过得非常充实。骆靖总是出人意料地友好,愿意提供帮助和建议,也从不期待任何回报。
        他是一个不可思议的人,很会讲故事,我很喜欢他的故事和意见。
        我很有幸认识骆靖,我非常想念他。

        在关于脉冲星计时的会议和学术谈话中,我一遍又一遍地听到他的名字。
        他显然是一位世界级的专家,才会受到这么多人的钦佩。
        他是一位才华横溢的科学家,受到同行的高度尊重。
        我很遗憾将永远没有机会跟他交谈。
        这是可怕的损失和可怕的悲剧,他还这么年轻,在他巅峰时刻和充满希望的时候就这么走了。

        “骆靖在 CITA 绝对是令人难忘的存在。
        我永远不会忘记我们过去是如何开玩笑说在大楼里做戴帽子的人的,还有他是如何把我拉进一个“恶作剧”的,我们把每个人的照片都换成了画作。
        靖总是很谦虚,却很有趣,他会把他戴着标志性帽子的自画像画到黑板上。
        他曾送我一块梵高的冰箱贴,还有一顶帽子；我至今仍把这些礼物挂同朋友们送的其它珍贵礼物挂在家里的白板上。
        我希望我能告诉他我很珍惜那些礼物,而且他的存在从各个方面来讲就是一种宝藏。
        好好休息吧,太空牛仔。” —— 艾米莉·泰赫斯特（Emily Tyhurst）

        这实在是太让人伤心了。 我对骆靖最深刻的印象是他在 CITA
        的休息室,特别是在我们每周五的甜点聚会中。骆靖展现了非常独特的生活情趣。就和他头顶上高大威武的牛仔帽一样,他总是展现出宽广的胸襟,他倾听并关怀他身边的每一个人。对于他在学术界的同事和朋友来说这真是非常巨大的损失。我想对于他的家人来说那更是巨大的伤痛。我会记住他的人格魅力。我想给每一个在悼念中的朋友一个拥抱。—

        我第一次见到骆靖是他来到美国攻读硕士学位的时候。
        他像是个看起来憨憨的孩子,并且能和每一个刚接触他的人立刻成为朋友。我和他是非常要好的朋友。我们在美国是同班同学,还是舍友,他总是能让我感到很高兴。我们一开始在美国都是人生地不熟的外国人,经常彼此照应。我怀念我们在沙发上观看《指环王》、《银河追缉令》,下班后在
        PS4
        游戏机上玩《无主之地》,为失去女朋友而哭泣,讨论工作中的问题,讨论伊伦·马斯克（SpaceX
        的创始人）,一起吃完饭并畅谈各自理想等等这些共同时光。他是我的朋友和启蒙人,也是我完成博士学位过程中必不可少的精神支柱。在离开博士班后,我们甚至曾经在中国、德国见面。我无法相信他离开了我们。我会经常想念他的。——苏拉

        听到这个消息我很震惊。 圣地亚哥（骆靖） 对 Forró
        团队（注：多伦多大学的一个舞蹈社团）来说是一位非常熟悉的面孔,他总是愿意学习新的舞蹈动作并尝试它们。在去年
        12
        月的最后一堂课上,他还在和我一起开玩笑,我试图给他领舞,他努力地跟随,尽管他比我高了一英尺。有一个动作是领舞者放开舞伴,舞伴将双手举过头顶。我们尝试了这个动作,但是我们失误得很糟糕,而且不得不因为彼此笑得太太厉害而停下舞步！圣地亚哥博士,你会非常想念你的。

        骆靖,圣地亚哥（Santiago）,大约在 4 年前,也就是 2018 年开始参加
        Forró
        舞蹈班（注：多伦多大学的一个舞蹈社团）。他非常渴望学习,有时他会开玩笑说他和“作为一名指导员之一的”我一起跳舞很紧张。他喜欢在跳舞时让人欢笑,总是带着灿烂的笑容和不住的赞美。只要不耽误他的工作和接待家人,他参加了我们的特别活动（在我们的圣约翰派对期间,戴着他的牛仔帽和小胡子,他还在派对上与其他人分享了那些小胡子）和研讨会。这个悲伤的消息让我们的圈子感到震惊。我上次看到圣地亚哥是在
        2021 年 12 月,当时我们重新开始了面对面的课程。有一节课他带来了 2
        个朋友,也是他们友善地通过电子邮件告知了我们这个悲伤的消息。我们跳过很多舞,他还曾在把书包落在练舞室,第二天不得不去我家取回。无论在跳舞时或是任何课后的社交活动中,他一直会是活动的焦点。圣地亚哥充满生机和善良,总是欢迎人们并与之分享他对生活的热爱。我们为他的家人和朋友祈祷。

        暑假来 CITA
        实习的时候认识了骆靖。我俩跟研究团队一起去阿冈昆安装圣诞树养料。他为我们设计了一个标志和印制的徽章,就像我们是一个执行特殊任务的小队一样,真的很有趣。
        （我仍然自豪地把这个徽章挂在我的背包上！）有天晚上,我们几个人和他一起乘独木舟在整个湖划了一个来回。我们可以清晰地看到银河系和远处的射电望远镜。这是我永远不会忘记的一个晚上,这要归功于靖提议我们去划独木舟。还有一个晚上,大家都睡了之后,我和他一直醒着,聊了很久。那天晚上之后,我觉得我交到了一个新的最好的朋友。那个夏天我所有最美好的回忆都有他。他让我在一个很孤独和陌生的环境中感到非常受欢迎。我在多伦多逗留的时间很短,我和他相处的时间也没有我所希望的那么多。我向他的家人和朋友表示哀悼。

        "骆靖/圣地亚哥一直是我在多伦多跳 forro
        舞种的群组所办的舞蹈活动中最喜欢的舞伴之一。他每次跳舞都是以灿烂的笑容和热情的问候开始的。不管我们的舞蹈动作是否正确,他活泼的精神在我们分享的每一支舞蹈中创造了一种欢乐的气氛
        。他还非常认真地尝试学习困难的舞蹈序列 —我记得在 2021 年 11
        月试图和他一起学习一个舞蹈,因为我们一起笑得太厉害而我们不得不停止跳舞。对我来说,他给人的感觉是一个真正的绅士,他对每个舞伴都很关心。因为他不是一个简单地走过场式生活的人,我认为他的去世更格外令人心碎。我感觉到他试著去真正享受并充分善用他的每一个时刻,也尽情享受和爱惜他生命中的每一段关系。我希望他能有更多的时间。我向他的家人和朋友致以衷心的慰问。"
